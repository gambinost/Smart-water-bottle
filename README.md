# Smart water bottle

### Main Idea:

## Creating a Smart Fitness Bottle (SFB) that is suited for users who wish for automation everywhere around them.

## The SFB is like a fitness Pal: it reminds the user  to drink water if he hasn’t for a while and the user  can also set reminders to drink water at specific times of the day.

## The bottle also monitors your heart rate and the temperature and humidity around you. 
It can detect whenever the environment around you is too harsh and reminds to take a break.

### Overall, the SFB is the best fitness Pal an athlete can wish for
